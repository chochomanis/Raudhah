                Hello! My name is Nur Raudhah Binti Mohd Rezal. I am 21 years old. Born and raised in Malacca.
                I am currently a student in a Bachelor of Information System Management in UiTM Puncak Perdana.
                I can speak Malay and English and I have basic skill of html. If I had to describe myself in 3 words
                it would be hardworking, well organized and passionate.I am hardworking because I will make sure my
                asssignment are on progression so that I can turn in my assignment complete and on time. I am very
                organized person. I like to know exactly what I am going for the day. I outline my tasks and organize 
                my time and work better. I am passionate about my work because I love what I do.
